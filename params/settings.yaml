## Settings.YAML file
## this file is used to define the main parameters the framework will use.
## before each experiment, make sure to edit these parameters with what's needed.
## for each parameter, a set of possible options are given in the comments.
## to add support for more classifiers, you can edit ./classes/handlers/ModelsHandler and choose the respective classifier here.
